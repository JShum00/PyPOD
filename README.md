## üß† Notes
The .POD/.pod format was used by Terminal Reality's EVO engine (circa 2000s).
The POD file was used to store game assets and data in a proprietary format, 
these PODs were not compressing game data, rather a collective place to store them.
An example is `TRUCK.POD` in 4x4 Evo 2, which kept the truck game models, textures, and more.
